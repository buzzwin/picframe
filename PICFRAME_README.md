## üéØ Best Practices

### Photography Tips

1. Take photos straight-on (not at an angle)
2. Ensure good lighting
3. Include the full wall area
4. Remove any existing decorations for clearer analysis

### Layout Design Tips

1. Start with odd numbers of frames (3, 5, 7) for dynamic looks
2. Mix frame sizes for visual interest
3. Maintain consistent spacing throughout
4. Consider furniture placement below the wall
5. Test layouts with paper templates before hanging

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Hanging frames too high
- Inconsistent spacing
- Frames too small for the wall
- Ignoring architectural features
- Poor lighting consideration

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to analyze wall"

- Check your Gemini API key is correct
- Ensure the image is a valid format (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Try with a smaller image size
- Check your internet connection

### Layout looks off

- Verify wall dimensions are accurate
- Try different frame count
- Consider architectural features in your photo
- Regenerate with different preferences

### Export not working

- Check browser permissions for downloads
- Try a different browser
- Ensure you're not in private/incognito mode
